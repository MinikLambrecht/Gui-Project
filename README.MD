**Error & Status Codes:**

**Codes 2xx:**

-   Code: 200 (_OK_)

        Indicates that the REST API successfully carried out the requested action, 
        the methods used in these requests are (GET, HEAD, POST, TRACE).
-   Code 201 (_Created_)

        The REST API responds whenever a resource is created.
-   Code 202 (_Accepted_)

        Typically used for long processes such as loading a page, 
        authenticating information or an batch-oriented process etc.
-   Code 204 (_No Content_)

        Sent to a PUT, POST or DELETE Request when the REST API declines 
        to send back any status message or response overall.

**Codes 3xx:**

-   Code 301 (_Moved Permanently_)

        Indicates that the REST APIs resource model has been modified ,
        and a new permanent URI has been assigned the the resource.
-   Code 302 (_Found_)

        HTTP Response 302 is a common way of performing URL redirection.
-   Code 303 (_See Other_)

        Indicates that a controller resource has finished its work, 
        but instead of sending a potentially unwanted response body, it 
        sends the client URI of a response resource.
-   Code 304 (_Not Modified_)

        Used when the resource has not been modified 
        since the version specified by the request headers 
        If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match
-   Code 307 (_Temporary Redirect_)

        Indicates that the REST API is not going to process the clients request. 
        Instead, the client should resubmit the request to the
        URI specified by the response messageâ€™s Location header

**Codes 4xx:**

-   Code 400 (_Bad Request_)
        
        The generic client-side error status used 
        when no other 4xx is appropiate.
-   Code 401 (_Unauthorized_)

        Indicates that the client tried to operate on a protected resource
        without providing the proper authorization.
-   Code 403 (_Forbidden_)

        Indicates that the clients request is formed correctly, 
        but the REST API refuses to hono it i.e. 
        the user does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.
-   Code 404 (_Not Found_)

        Indicates that the REST SPI can't map the clients URI to a resource,
        but may be available in the future.
-   Code 405 (_Method Not Allowed_)

        Indicates that the client tried to use an HTTP method that the resource does not allow i.e.
        a read-only resource could support only GET and HEAD, 
        while a controller resource might allow GET & Post, but not PUT & DELETE.
-   Code 406 (_Not Acceptable_)

        Indicates that the API is not able to generate any of the clients preferred media types,
        as indicated by the Accept request header.
-   Code 412 (_Precondition Failed_)

        Indicates that the client specified one or more preconditions in its request headers, 
        effectively telling the REST API to carry 
        out its request onlt if certain conditions were met.
-   Code 415 (_Unsupported Media Type_)

        Indicates that he API is not able to process the client's supplied media type,
        as indicated by the content-Type request header.

**Codes 5xx:**

-   Code 500 (_Internal Server Error_)

        Most web frameworks automatically responds with this reponse status code,
        whenever they execute som request hadler code that raises an exception.
-   Code 501 (_Not Implemented_)

        The server either does not recognize the request method, 
        or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.
